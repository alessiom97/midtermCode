Midterm- The De-Donalder and the Word Scrambler
============

For my midterm I initially wanted to make an extension that would allow you to highlight text, and then insert it
into a popup that would scramble it for you. My hope was that it could produce some interesting content, as  
computerized randomisation is pretty cool to me. Unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to use the get selection
Chrome function. My second extension was very simple- it just would eliminate any mention of Trump from a website.
I am working on it now to include images.
